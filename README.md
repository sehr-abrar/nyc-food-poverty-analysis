# NYC Food Poverty Prediction Analysis

## Project Description
This project aims to analyze and predict neighborhood-level poverty in New York City using publicly available datasets. The goal is to support the **United Nations Sustainable Development Goal #1: No Poverty** by providing data-driven insights to identify high-risk areas and inform policy decisions. Using machine learning models, this project forecasts poverty rates, identifies key contributing factors, and helps allocate resources effectively.

---

## Scope & Objectives
- Explore patterns and trends in NYC poverty and child poverty across neighborhoods (census tracts).  
- Identify high-risk neighborhoods using predictive modeling.  
- Understand key socioeconomic, demographic, and employment-related factors driving poverty.  
- Evaluate different machine learning models for accuracy and reliability.  
- Provide actionable insights for policymakers and NGOs.

## Documentation
All project materials are organized for reproducibility and review:  
- **`data`:** Raw and merged datasets used in analysis.  
- **`notebooks`:** Jupyter notebooks containing data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and modeling.  
- **`documents`:** Presentations and papers.
